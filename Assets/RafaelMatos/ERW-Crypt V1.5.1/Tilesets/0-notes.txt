*Notes
-Unity's Rule tile system alternative
Since Unity's default rule tile system is somehow limited and does not cover some aspects of autotiling out of the box, tilesets with multiple heights(e.g walls
with 2 or more tiles of height) have no rule tile setup. Premade corners are provided for these tilesets to make it easier to draw.

-TiledMap Editor alternative
All tilesets have full autotile support and this is as easy as selecting a brush for a specific tileset and start drawing.
2D Map Editor: Tiled Map Editor
Tiled Map Editor maps to Unity: Super Tiled2Unity (This should be imported to Unity as a package)


-----------

For the balluster 4 auto tile, I'd recommend using the rectangular brush(U) because the inner tile(full tile) is transparent so
It's easier to draw/remove using the rectangular brush
